I downloaded the file "titanic3.csv" from this page:

http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets

I would recommend using the cleaned version "titanic3.clean.reordered.csv"

I used the R script csv.clean.up.R to remove some incomplete rows and to re-order the columns (target variable at the end).
